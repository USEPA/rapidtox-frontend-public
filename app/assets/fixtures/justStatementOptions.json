Chemical-specific data are available to partially inform toxicokinetics and/or toxicodynamics in humans.", "A UFH of 1 is applied to account for human interindividual variability in susceptibility. Chemical-specific data are available to characterize toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in humans."],
    "Animal to Human Extrapolation (UF<sub>A</sub>)": ["A UFA of 3 is applied to account for uncertainty associated with extrapolating from experimental animals to humans. Cross-species oral toxicokinetics have been addressed via dosimetric adjustment in the calculation of a human equivalent dose (HED) (U.S. EPA, 2011). Residual uncertainty remains in the relative cross-species sensitivity in toxicodynamics.",
        "A UFA of 3 is applied to account for uncertainty associated with extrapolating from experimental animals to humans. Cross-species inhalation toxicokinetics have been addressed via dosimetric adjustment for extrarespiratory effects from a Category 3 gas, as specified in U.S. EPA (1994) for deriving RfCs. Residual uncertainty remains in the relative cross-species sensitivity in toxicodynamics.",
        "A UFA of 3 is applied to account for uncertainty associated with extrapolating from experimental animals to humans. Cross-species inhalation toxicokinetics have been addressed via dosimetric adjustment for airway effects from a Category 1 gas, as specified in U.S. EPA (1994) for deriving RfCs. Residual uncertainty remains in the relative cross-species sensitivity in toxicodynamics.",
        "A UFA of 1 is applied to account for uncertainty associated with extrapolating from experimental animals to humans. Cross-species toxicokinetic differences are accounted for using dosimetric adjustment in the calculation of an oral human equivalent dose (HED) (U.S. EPA, 2011) or inhalation human equivalent concentration (HEC) (U.S. EPA, 1994). Available toxicodynamic data indicate that humans are quantitatively equal to or more sensitive to biological perturbation(s) than experimental animals."],
    "Subchronic-to-Chronic (UF<sub>S</sub>)": ["A UFS of 10 is applied as there are no hazard and dose-response data available from longer-term (e.g., chronic) duration studies.",
        "A UFS of 1 is applied because the DRSV comes from a developmental study. The developmental period is recognized as a susceptible life stage in which exposure during certain time windows (e.g., gestational; neonatal) is more relevant to the induction of developmental effects than lifetime exposure."],
    "LOAEL to NOAEL (UF<sub>L</sub>)": ["A UFL of 10 is applied because the DRSV is a free-standing LOAEL; no NOAEL was identified.",
        "A UFL of 1 is applied for LOAEL-to-NOAEL extrapolation because the DRSV is a BMDL.",

    "Database (UF<sub>D</sub>)": ["A UFD of 10 is applied due to significant hazard and dose-response database deficiencies.",

        "A UFD of 3 is applied due to hazard and dose-response database deficiencies. (USER: please add specific duration, route, effect, and/or sex-specific gaps in the available database)",
        "A UFD of 1 is applied as there are no deficiencies in the available hazard and dose-response database for the specific RfV being derived."]
