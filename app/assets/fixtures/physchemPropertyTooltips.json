  "Atmospheric Hydroxylation Rate": "A measure of the rate at which a chemical is hydroxylated (i.e., addition of a -OH moiety) by oxidant species in the atmosphere.",
  "Bioaccumulation Factor": "Bioaccumulation is the general term process by which chemicals are taken up by a plant or animal either directly from exposure to a contaminated medium (soil, sediment, water) or by eating food containing the chemical. The bioaccumulation factor is the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in an organism to the concentration of the chemical in its surrounding environment. ",
  "Bioconcentration Factor": "A measure of the extent of a chemical partitioning at equilibrium between a biological medium such as fish tissue or plant tissue and an external medium such as water. The higher the BCF, the greater the accumulation in living tissue(s).",
  "Biodegradation Half-Life": "The length of time it takes for the concentration or dose of a substance to be reduced by one-half through decomposition or breakdown via the action of microorganisms (such as bacteria or fungi) or other natural physical degradation processes (such as UV light).",
  "Boiling Point": "The temperature at which a chemical's vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. Boiling point is a relative indicator of volatility and generally increases with increasing molecular weight.",
  "Density": "The amount of mass per unit volume.",
  "Fish Biotransformation Half-Life (Km)": "The time for chemical concentration in the fish to be reduced to exactly half of its initial concentration due to biotransformation processes within the fish.",
  "Henry's Law": "A measure of the content of chemical partitioning between air and water at equilibrium. The higher the Henry's Law constant, the more likely a chemical is to volatize than to remain in water.",
  "LogKoa: Octanol-Air": "A measure of the extent of chemical partitioning between air and octanol at equilibrium. The greater the Koa the more likely a chemical is to partition to octanol than to remain in air. Octanol is used as a surrogate for lipids (fat), and Koa can be used to predict bioconcentration of chemical(s) in organisms via exposure to air.",
  "LogKow: Octanol-Water": "A measure of the extent of chemical partitioning between water and octanol at equilibrium. The greater the Kow the more likely a chemical is to partition to octanol than to remain in water. Octanol is used as a surrogate for lipids (fat), and Kow can be used to predict bioconcentration of chemical(s) in organisms via exposure to water.",
  "Melting Point": "The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium.",
  "Molar Volume": "The volume occupied by one mole of a substance at a given temperature and pressure. It is equal to the molar mass (M) divided by the mass density (œÅ).",
  "Soil Adsorption Coefficient (Koc)": "A measure of the extent of chemical partitioning between organic carbon in soil or sediment to the concentration in water at equilibrium. The higher the Koc, the more likely a chemical is to bind to sediment than to remain in water.",
  "Surface Tension": "The tension of the surface film of a liquid caused by the attraction of the particles in the surface layer by the bulk of the liquid, which tends to minimize surface area",
  "Vapor Pressure": "The pressure exerted by a chemical vapor in equilibrium with its solid or liquid form at any given temperature. It is used to calculate the rate of volatilization of a pure substance from a surface or in estimating a Henry's Law constant for chemicals with low water solubility. The higher the vapor pressure, the more likely a chemical is to exist in a gaseous state.",
  "Water Solubility": "An upper limit on a chemical's dissolved concentration in water at a specified temperature. Aqueous concentrations in excess of solubility may indicate sorption onto sediments, the presence of solubilizing chemicals such as solvents, or the presence of a nonaqueous phase liquid."
